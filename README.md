# Number Teaching Game - RECAL Project

## Task

Create a Client Server program (Java/Python)with three different client windows instead of one
browser window. All three windows have the same picture. But the number below is different.

For example:

When the correct answer is clicked, all the three windows must display the correct answer with a
smiley.

If the wrong window is clicked, then a try again message is popped up. The display remains the
same till the correct window is clicked.

Then the numbers 2,3,4,5 are displayed with corresponding pictures of apples to make kindergarten
children learn counting.

It is similar to the website <https://www.tinytap.com/activities/g361/play/numbers-123>. But has
three windows instead of one.

Store the pictures and numbers in a database.
